[x] When the player reaches the bottom , of the map, they should get large text on the screen that flashes and says: Search the seabed! Find the abyssal trench!
[x] At that point after the player has moved 250m or so in either direction a trench appears below the sea bed. when they enter they get teleported to a final boss fight.
[x] If the player is more then 300m away from the trench horizontally, they should get static text that says: The water goes no deeper this way!
